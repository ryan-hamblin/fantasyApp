##### This will be a Web Application that will allow users of the Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues to do some research on
professional football players. It will be built primarily in AngularJS and I will be using Flex-Box in CSS to do a lot of
tweaking with the styles. It is going to be a fun experiment!
