#### Fantasy App


This will be a Web Application that will allow users of the Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues to do some Data research on professional football players. It will be built primarily in AngularJS and I will be using Flex-Box in CSS to do a lot of
tweaking with the styles. On top of that I will be using a little bit of jQuery for some I will also be using Firebase for this project.
It is going to be a fun experiment!
